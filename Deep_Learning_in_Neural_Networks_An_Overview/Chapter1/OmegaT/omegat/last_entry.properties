LAST_ENTRY_SRC=Unlike traditional methods for automatic sequential program synthesis\u00A0<u1>[e.g.,][]{waldinger69,balzer1985,soloway1986,Deville\:94}, RNNs can learn programs that mix sequential and parallel information processing in a natural and efficient way, exploiting the massive parallelism viewed as crucial for sustaining the rapid decline of computation cost observed over the past 75 years.
